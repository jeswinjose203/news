                Dont assume 
                It's important not to make assumptions. Assuming can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes that could have easily been avoided. Instead, take the time to gather all the necessary information and ask questions if needed. By doing so, you can ensure that you have a clear and accurate understanding of the situation at hand. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry.

                  ELTD, or Experience Learning Takeaway Discovery, is a method of learning that emphasizes hands-on experiences and discovery-based learning. This approach allows learners to actively engage with the material and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. ELTD is particularly effective for subjects that require practical application, such as science, technology, engineering, and math. By using ELTD, learners can develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a greater appreciation for the subject matter.
